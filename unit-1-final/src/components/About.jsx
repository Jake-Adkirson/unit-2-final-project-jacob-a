        <p>I have been an avid camper and floater for years, and I was finally tired of dealing with disorganized events due to a lack of proper planning. I created this app to help you and your friends plan great camping events that are easily managed. Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope it can benefit you and your group!</p>
